**BOX MODEL**:

1. Content : Text, images etc
2. Padding: transparent area around the content, inside the box
3. Border: Goes around the padding and content
4. Margin: White Space between different boxes, page boundaries.

- Use border box so that you can modify height and width of boxes, disabled by default.
- top, right, bottom etc signify distance between parent element and current element.
- parent element should be relative.
- inline block doesn't cause new line, while block does.

**INLINE ELEMENTS**:
- Content and objects whose properties can't be modified.

**CONVENTIONS**:
- Remove default margins and paddings by setting them to 0 globally
- box-sizing to border box as mentioned above (its for the content by default)
- Responsive Web Design: 
    - Use of Fluid Grid: Such that all elements are sized in relative units
    - Flexible Images: those sized in relative units
    - Media Queries: Specify CSS for different browser widths
